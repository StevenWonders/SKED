   // PROTIP:
   /*
    When using bootstrap-sass, it's recommended to avoid sprockets in your
    stylesheets. In order to do that you simply rename your `application.css` file
    to `application.css.scss`, remove all sprockets comments, and instead use sass
    `@import` commands. These commands are smart enough to fully support asset
    pipeline load paths, thanks to `sass-rails` gem.
